-15pts Data Retrieval: Data is not retrieved and displayed from local storage. You have several lines in your JavaScript file that are breaking your code (example lines 11-18) Removing these seems to make some of the code work.
-10pts Form Validation: Form does not validate.
-5pts: Missing delete and update data functions.
We may need to set up a time to go through your code together to help you get your project working. It looks like you have a lot of what is needed here but there are some errors preventing your code from working. When I removed some of the errors a lot of the code starts to function but there are still some things that are being return as null.
