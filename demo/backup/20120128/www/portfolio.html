<p>				What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</p>
<p class="mod-text">Okay, so I tried to find the details on these and below are the results.
    <ul>
		<li>iOS/Android</li>
		<li>Accelerometer YES/YES</li>
		<li>Camera NO/NO</li>
		<li>Compass YES - iOS 5/Not sure</li>
		<li>Contacts YES/YES</li>
		<li>Geolocation YES/YES</li>
		<li>Notification - For the most part no, but if you have your own provider server you could.  To use Apple's Push Notification or Cloud to Device Message you must have a native app.  I wasn't able to find anything specific on Android, but I believe it would be the same for security reasons.</li>
		<li>Storage YES/YES
		</li>
    </ul>
</p>

 For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?
  I would like to implement Contacts, Camera, Geolocation, Notifications, and Storage.  I don't see any practical application for the Accelerometer


Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.
Planning is key. If you don't start off having your roadmap, then you will waste a lot of resources such as time and money.

<a href="#week2" ></a>
<h2  class="mod-subtitle">Accessibility</h2>
<p>There are many options for developers when it comes to making their web sites or applications accessible to everyone. For elements that would require text alternatives
Recommendations for My App
<ul>
	<li>Text Alternatives</li>

	<li>Alt tags
	At the bare minimum all elements should include alt tags that provide value.
	Another route would be to include the longdesc attribute where possible. Make these tags meaningful.
	<li>Page Titles
	Using proper page titles for each part of the web site or application.
	Avoiding the use of pictures replacement via CSS or pictures of words.
	Replace any onmouse or onkey triggers with the onclick trigger.

	<li>Video
	Native HTML5 video controls that will allow users to take advantage of keyboard controls.
	Add descriptions, subtitles, and captions to videos through the use of vtt.

	<li>Forms
	For my crud app, I could make sure to use label elements to associate text labels with form controls.

	<li>Content Presentation</li>
	<li>Arrange content in a linear order that makes sense when you can't see the entire page or layout. If you were to go to a </li>
	<li>web site with only the voice over turned on would the structure make sense?
	</li>
	<li>The use of scripting languages.</li>
	<li>Browsers built for those with Accessibility needs often turn off scripting languages and do not include plug-ins. By trying to reduce the amount of plugins used within an application and by providing alternatives for browsers that don't support scripting. At this point in my application I could check to see if the browser supports scripting and if it doesn't, at least provide a notification of some sort that will be accessible by the user.

	There are many frustrations when it comes to users with accessibility needs and web services. Some of the common frustrations that users with accessibility needs experience are with applications such as flash. Without the proper approach by the content creator, flash content is often useless to those with visual impairment. Many times the video will be set to loop which causes the screenreader to get caught in a loop. Which, if the user does not know how to exit, can prove extremely frustrating.
	</li>
	<li>iPhone/iPad</li>
	<li>Apple goes above and beyond when it comes to accessibility on their devices. The voice over feature proves quite powerful for those with visual impairment. The rotor is a virtual control which allows users to navigate their device in different ways. These are set according to their preferences. The rotor allows users to navigate a page word by word or character by character. The rotor can also be used to navigate web pages. Another feature is Siri. Siri allows users to text, email, schedule meetings, set a reminder, and place phone calls via voice command. For those with partial visual impairment iOS devices allow users to zoom in on any part of the screen. It is also possible to switch the screen from black on white to white on black for higher screen contrast.
	While working for Apple, I kind of stumbled into becoming knowledgeable about accessibility options for Apple computers, and iOS devices. I would have customers who would come in looking for solutions that met their accessibility needs. I had customers who would tell others with accessibility needs to come in and ask for me. We would go over the features above to see how Apple products could enrich their lives.
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
	<li>
	LookTel Money Reader
	Recognizes currency denominations and speaks them to user.
	http://www.looktel.com/
	</li>
	<li>Audible
	Can be used by those who would like to use their iOS device to read but have visual impairment.
	http://www.audible.com/wireless/iphone
	</li>
	<li>Sign 4 Me for iOS
	Shows 3D representation of how to sign a phrase.

<h2  class="mod-subtitle">Market Research</h2>
<a href="#week3"  class="mod-subtitle"></a>

<p>
What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?  What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan and Great Britain?
The largest categories involve entertainment and social networking.  The top categories being games, social networking apps, and those that deal with entertainment.
It seems that Great Britain and Japan share similar interestes as the US.  Games seem to be a common trend that occupy a lot of users time and attention.  Apps like Angry Birds or Plants VS Zombies, and Words with Friends.

 Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?
Users are carrying mobile devices with them more now than ever.  Their desire for entertainment during the small breaks or microbreaks of their day tend to lean towards the gaming market.  Many of the games on mobiel devices fit their desires being low cost and highly entertaining.  The driving force of social gaming is another thing to consider.  People are sharing more now than ever before.  This comes while playing games, watching TV or movies, and taking vacations.

  What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?
The data that I found suggested that .3% of Android users have 4.0 or greater on their phone.  While the greatest percentage being Android 2.3.3-2.3.7, Gingerbread at 54%.  If you are developing for the Android platform you have to consider the users that are still running 2.2 or less.  How is this going to affect your application.  What features will you have to leave out to appeal to this demographic of users?  Developers on the Android platform are at a great disadvantage when it comes to making use of the latest OS.

 What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?
  US $42.00 for 2GB, Great Britain $25 for 2GB, Japan $12 for 2GB.  Well, it will be something that developers will need to consider when developing applications.  Taking into account the target market of the app and the cost for data usage.  If an app is a media rich app using lots of data, this will greatly impact the way an application is developed.

  And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.
  There are many factors to consider.  The term that depends comes up a lot.  If you are seeking to develop an app to sell for profit you have to consider what platforms you can be most effective on.  iOS users tend to buy more apps than Android users.  As a developer, you also have to keep in mind the cost of development and market segmentation.  Android is on many different devices with different technical specifications.  Where iOS users are a more simplified market when it comes to developing.  They tend to have the latest OS and have fewer devices to develop for.  If the app that you are developing is something that you want available on all major mobile operating systems, then you have different factors to consider.  The Android Market Place is flooded with imitation apps that may look like the app that you develop and therefore make it more difficult for your users to find the app.  The difficulty Android users face when updating their OS is another thing to consider.  As a developer, do you want to continue to support several versions of the OS.  Doing so adds more work and increases the size of the application.  It also somewhat limits what can be done within the application.  iOS may have a smaller percentage of the market than Android, but it is also the most profitable.  Developers don't have to get everyone to buy their app if they get only a small percentage of the market to buy their app on iOS that still results in high sales figures.  An app on the Android Market may reach more handsets, but they might be harder to find and less likely to spend the money on the application.  This would decrease the value of the number of handsets that Android is on.  Another thing to consider is the new Windows Phone.  This looks to be another possibility for developers and handset makers when it comes to choosing an OS.  It will be interesting to see how the purchase of Motorola will effect the other handset makers choice in mobile OS.  Will they stick with Android or will they seek to go after Windows.
So, I would tend to lean towards the iOS market in the non-gaming categories.  I am currenlty working on two app ideas in the medical category and productivity is a huge passion of mine.  Ultimately, when it comes to the app it will depend on what type of business model I am going for.  For a productivity application, I am looking for mass adoption and so multiple platforms would be an important factor to consider.  In the medical categories, this is a tough market because of the health care industry.  I plan on starting with a simplified version of my product and expanding once enough testing has been done to justify further development.
