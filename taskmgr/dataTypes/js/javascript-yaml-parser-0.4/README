DESCRIPTION

This project intends to implement a simple YAML parser. It does not intend to
implement all the aspects formalized in the YAML specs, but rather to implement
a robust parser in Javascript, enough to load simply structured YAML files,
without depending on external libraries and as compatible as possible with all
Javascript-powered browsers.

INSTALLATION

To use the parser, copy 'src/yaml.js' to your javascript-files folder and 
include it in your page:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="yaml.js"></script>

Then use the functions 'YAML.fromURL' or 'YAML.eval' to parse a YAML file.

DOCUMENTATION

In the 'lib' folder, you can find the JSDoc toolkit.
This toolkit is used to generate the documentation for the project.
The documentation is in the folder 'doc'. 
Use a web browser to visualize 'index.html', the base file of the documentation.
To generate the documentation again, open a terminal and navigate to the folder
where the file 'Makefile' is. Then, run the command 'make'. This will generate
the documentation.
