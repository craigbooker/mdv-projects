PhoneListener
============

Installation
------------

This plugin allows your application to monitor changes in the phone's state (RINGING, OFFHOOK and IDLE) so that you can respond to them appropriately (pause your Media stream, etc).

Add the plugin much like any other:

1.      Add the PhoneListener.js file to your 'assets/www' folder
2.      Create an 'org/devgeeks' folder under 'src' and add the PhoneListener.java file to it
3.		Add the PhoneListener.js to your html file. eg: `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="PhoneListener.js"></script>`
4.      Add the plugin to the 'res/xml/plugins.xml' file. eg: `<plugin name="PhoneListener" value="org.devgeeks.PhoneListener"/>`
5.		Make sure you have allowed the permission 'READ_PHONE_STATE' in your 'AndroidManifest.xml. eg: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />`

### Example
```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	PhoneListener.start(onPhoneStateChanged,onError);
	// or...
	// PhoneListener.stop(onSuccess,onError);
}

function onPhoneStateChanged(phoneState) 
{
	switch (phoneState) {
		case "RINGING":
			console.log('Phone is ringing.');
			break;
		case "OFFHOOK":
			console.log('Phone is off the hook.');
			break;
		case "IDLE":
			console.log('Phone has returned to the idle state.');
			break;
		default:
			// no default...
	}
}

function onError(error) {
	// do something...
}
function onSuccess() {
	// do something else...
}
```
