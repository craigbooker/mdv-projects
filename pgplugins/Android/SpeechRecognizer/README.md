# Android SpeechRecognizer plugin for Phonegap #

This plugin will recognize commands, phrases, etc as spoken by the user.
A collection of possible matches (strings) are returned to your app.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Of course this plugin requires [Android PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android).

1. To install the plugin, copy SpeechRecognizer.js to your project's www folder.
2. Add SpeechRecognizer.js to your html file, eg: `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="SpeechRecognizer.js"></script>`
3. Create an 'com/urbtek/phonegap' path under 'src' and add the SpeechRecognizer.java file to it
4. Add the plugin to the 'res/xml/plugins.xml' file. eg: `<plugin name="SpeechRecognizer" value="com.urbtek.phonegap.SpeechRecognizer"/>`

### Example
```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
    window.plugins.speechrecognizer.init(speechInitOk, speechInitFail);
    // etc.
}

function speechInitOk() {
	// we're good
}
function speechInitFail(m) {
	// recognizer not present?
}

function recognizeSpeech() {
    var requestCode = 1234;
    var maxMatches = 5;
    var promptString = "Please say a command";
    window.plugins.speechrecognizer.startRecognize(speechOk, speechFail, requestCode, maxMatches, promptString);
}

function speechOk(result) {
    var match, respObj, requestCode;
    if (result) {
        respObj = JSON.parse(result);
        if (respObj) {
            // This is the code that was sent with the original request
            requestCode = respObj.speechMatches.requestCode;
            
            for (match in respObj.speechMatches.speechMatch) {
                console.log("possible match: " + match);
                // regex comes in handy for dealing with these match strings
            }
        }        
    }
}

function speechFail(m) {
    console.log("speechFail: " + m.toString());
}

```
