HockeyApp PhoneGap Plugin
by Owen Brotherwood

http://hockeyapp.net is a fantastic help for any budding App maker.

Please note that the commercial service is based on the Open Source:
- http://hockeykit.net 
- http://quincykit.net.
I chose the name HockeyApp as it contains the meaning of both kits...

Implements the most basic needs in the HockeyKit, via javascript :)

Demos based on the v1.0.0 PhoneGap default Xcode (4.02) Project.

The projectfiles contains a script, makeIT, that creates a directory structure and collects HockeyKit and QuincyKit.
Also, not that the HockeyApp.js is copied into the www folders by the build script (otherwise I will have multiple instances of the js ...)

- good list of possible functions to implement

https://github.com/TheRealKerni/QuincyKit/wiki
- hmm, have to find the same as HockeyKit ...

Get going ...
1 Install PhoneGap Version 1.0
2 Run the makeIT in a directory for your work
3 Find the demo project you would like to see
4 Run the demo

Note: the App ID in these demo's will stop at some stage as it is from a one month free trial.
