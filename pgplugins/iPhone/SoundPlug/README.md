# SoundPlug, iOS

## Rationale
This plugin makes it possible to play low-latency sounds in an iOS app.

The native JavaScript "Audio" object in iOS is not usable at all. The same goes for the PhoneGap "Media" object, that has high latency and other problems.

Multiple sounds can play at the same time and the same sound can play overlapping itself (essential for arcade games).

The plugin has been developed for use with the game Orbium (https://github.com/bni/orbium), but It should be generally useful for all games and multimedia apps.

## Usage
Add SoundPlug.m and SoundPlug.h to your xcode project (in the Plugins dir).

Add test.wav to xcode project as a resource.

Play sound in JavaScript like this:

```javascript
PhoneGap.exec("SoundPlug.play", "test.wav");

```

For an example on how to use SoundPlug plugins on multiple platforms, see this:
