# The PhoneGap Plugin Orphanage #

These are plugins that never had a JavaScript interface, never was documented nor cross-platform, but they existed in core PhoneGap. They have been removed for 1.0.0. They need a good home and lots of tender loving care (and a JS interface for their 1st birthday) - until they become adults and can live on their own.
