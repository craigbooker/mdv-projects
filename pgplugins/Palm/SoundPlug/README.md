# SoundPlug, webOS

## Rationale
This plugin makes it possible to play low-latency sounds in a webOS app.

The native JavaScript "Audio" object in webOS is not usable for playing sounds in games etc. The latency is too high, and playing multiple sounds for an extended period leads to various problems.

This plugin can be used in a webOS "hybrid" app. That is by using both browser code and native code in the .ipk.

The native code in this plugin uses SDL_mixer to play sound. This means multiple sounds can play at the same time and the same sound can play overlapping itself (essential for arcade games).

The plugin has been developed for use with the game Orbium (https://github.com/bni/orbium), but It should be generally useful for all games and multimedia apps.

## Usage
You must define a "object" element like this somewhere in your page (eg index.html, or in a mojo scene):

```html
<object id="soundPlug" width="1" height="1" type="application/x-palm-remote" x-palm-pass-event="true">
<param name="appid" value="<your-app-id>">
<param name="exe" value="soundplug_plugin">
<param name="Param1" value="0">
<param name="Param2" value="1">
</object>
```

Sounds can then be played from JavaScript like this:

```javascript
document.getElementById("soundPlug").play("boink.wav");

```

Copy boink.wav (and other sound files you have), to your project directory.

All the files from this repo must be added to your project.

Use build_plugin.sh to build the plugin binary itself.

This plugin has been built with the 3.0 SDK and verified to work on webOS 1.4.5 and 3.0. It should work on all versions and on all webOS hardware.
